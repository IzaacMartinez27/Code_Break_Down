# MoveNet Tutorial Breakdown

This document breaks down the MoveNet tutorial code into its constituent parts, explaining each section in detail.

## Introduction

MoveNet is a state-of-the-art pose detection model that identifies 17 key points of a human body. It's available in two variants: Lightning (for speed) and Thunder (for accuracy), suitable for real-time applications in health and fitness.

## Code Breakdown

### 1. Visualization Libraries & Imports

```python
!pip install -q imageio
!pip install -q opencv-python
!pip install -q git+https://github.com/tensorflow/docs

import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub
from tensorflow_docs.vis import embed
import numpy as np
import cv2
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.collections import LineCollection
import matplotlib.patches as patches
import imageio
from IPython.display import HTML, display
```

This block installs and imports necessary libraries. It includes TensorFlow for model loading and inference, OpenCV for image processing, and Matplotlib for visualization.

### 2. Helper Functions for Visualization

```python
# Dictionary mapping from joint names to keypoint indices
KEYPOINT_DICT = { ... }

# Maps bones to a matplotlib color name
KEYPOINT_EDGE_INDS_TO_COLOR = { ... }

def _keypoints_and_edges_for_display( ... ):
    ...

def draw_prediction_on_image( ... ):
    ...
```

These functions process the model's output and draw the detected keypoints and skeletal structure on the image.

### 3. Load Model from TF Hub

```python
model_name = "movenet_lightning"  # Choose between Lightning and Thunder

# Code to load the MoveNet model from TensorFlow Hub
if "tflite" in model_name:
    ...
    interpreter = tf.lite.Interpreter(model_path="model.tflite")
    ...
else:
    ...
    module = hub.load("https://tfhub.dev/google/movenet/singlepose/lightning/4")
    ...
```

This part loads the MoveNet model from TensorFlow Hub. It supports loading either the Lightning or Thunder variant, including their TFLite formats.

### 4. Single Image Example

```python
# Code demonstrating how to run the model on a single image

# Load and preprocess the input image
image_url = '...'
response = requests.get(image_url)
image_data = response.content
image = tf.image.decode_jpeg(image_data)

# Resize and pad the image
input_image = tf.image.resize_with_pad(input_image, input_size, input_size)

# Run model inference
keypoints_with_scores = movenet(input_image)

# Visualize the predictions
output_overlay = draw_prediction_on_image( ... )
```

This example shows how to load an image, preprocess it, run the MoveNet model on it, and visualize the results.

### 5. Video (Image Sequence) Example

```python
# Code for running inference on a sequence of frames (video)

# Cropping algorithm
def init_crop_region( ... ):
    ...

def determine_crop_region( ... ):
    ...

def crop_and_resize( ... ):
    ...

def run_inference( ... ):
    ...

# Load the input image sequence
image_path = 'dance.gif'
image = tf.image.decode_gif(image)

# Run inference with cropping algorithm
for frame_idx in range(num_frames):
    ...
    output_images.append(draw_prediction_on_image( ... ))

# Generate a GIF to visualize
output = np.stack(output_images, axis=0)
to_gif(output, duration=100)
```

This section extends the model's application to video frames. It includes a cropping algorithm that adjusts the focus dynamically based on the detected keypoints, and runs the model on each frame to visualize the pose detection in a GIF format.

## Conclusion

This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide on using MoveNet for human pose estimation, covering both single image and video inputs. It demonstrates the power and flexibility of MoveNet in various real-world applications.
