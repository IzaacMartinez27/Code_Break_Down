# Custom Linear Model for Image Classification

This code demonstrates the implementation of a custom linear model for image classification using PyTorch and Weights & Biases for experiment tracking.

## Installation

Before running the code, make sure to install the required libraries using the following commands:

```shell
!pip install wandb
!apt-get install poppler-utils
!pip install pdf2image
!pip install flashtorch
```

## Imports

```python
import requests
from pdf2image import convert_from_path
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import torch
import requests
from torchvision import *
from torchvision.models import *
import wandb as wb
```

In this section, we import the necessary libraries, including `wandb` for experiment tracking and various image processing tools.

## Device Setup

```python
device = torch.device("cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
```

Here, we check if a CUDA-compatible GPU is available and set the device accordingly.

## Utility Functions

```python
# GPU-related functions
def GPU(data):
    return torch.tensor(data, requires_grad=True, dtype=torch.float, device=device)

def GPU_data(data):
    return torch.tensor(data, requires_grad=False, dtype=torch.float, device=device)

# Other utility functions
# ...
```

These utility functions help with GPU data management, image plotting, and data preprocessing.

## Model Initialization

```python
alexnet_model = alexnet(weights='DEFAULT').to(device)
alexnet_model.eval()
```

Here, we initialize the AlexNet model with pre-trained weights and set it to evaluation mode.

## Data Retrieval and Preprocessing

```python
# Functions for downloading Google Slides and preprocessing images
# ...
```

These functions help download slides from Google Slides, convert them to images, and preprocess the images for input into the model.

## Image Classification

```python
# Performing image classification and printing labels
# ...
```

This section loads the images, performs classification using the AlexNet model, and prints the predicted labels.

## Custom Linear Model Definition

```python
# Custom linear model definition
class CustomLinearModel(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CustomLinearModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = torch.nn.Linear(1000, 2)  # Adjust based on the AlexNet output size

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear(x)
        return x  # Removed softmax here, as it's handled in the loss function
```

In this part, we define a custom linear model with a specified input size (1000) and 2 output units for binary classification.

## Training Loop and Weights & Biases Integration

```python
# Training the custom linear model and integrating with Weights & Biases
# ...
```

This section includes the training loop, where the custom linear model is trained on the extracted features from the AlexNet model. It also integrates with Weights & Biases for experiment tracking.

## Saving the Model

```python
# Saving the trained model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'flood_detection_model.pth')
```

Here, we save the trained custom linear model to a file named 'flood_detection_model.pth'.

This code provides a comprehensive overview of image classification, model training, and experiment tracking using PyTorch and Weights & Biases. You can follow these steps to create your own image classification model and track experiments.
