# Detailed Code Breakdown: Image Processing and Autoencoder Training

This script demonstrates various aspects of image processing, visualization, and autoencoder training using datasets like MNIST, KMNIST, and FashionMNIST.

## 1. Setup and Data Loading

### Importing Libraries and Defining Functions

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import torch
from torchvision import datasets
from skimage.util import montage
!pip install wandb
import wandb as wb
```

- Essential libraries for data manipulation, image processing, deep learning, and experiment tracking are imported.
- `plot` and `montage_plot` functions are defined for displaying images.

### Loading Image Datasets

```python
train_set = FashionMNIST('./data', train=True, download=True)
test_set = FashionMNIST('./data', train=False, download=True)
X = train_set.data.numpy()
X_test = test_set.data.numpy()
Y = train_set.targets.numpy()
Y_test = test_set.targets.numpy()
```

- FashionMNIST dataset is loaded, and images along with their labels are extracted.

### Data Preprocessing

```python
X = X[:, None, :, :] / 255
X_test = X_test[:, None, :, :] / 255
X = GPU_data(X)
Y = GPU_data(Y)
X_test = GPU_data(X_test)
Y_test = GPU_data(Y_test)
```

- Images are normalized and converted to tensors for GPU processing.

## 2. Visualizing Data

### Displaying Images and Montages

```python
plot(X[101, 0, :, :])
montage_plot(X[125:150, 0, :, :])
```

- Individual images and a montage of images from the dataset are visualized.

## 3. Simple Classifier Training

### Preparing Weights and Data for Training

```python
W = GPU(np.random.randn(784, 10))
x, y = get_batch('train')
```

- Initializes random weights for a simple linear classifier.
- Retrieves a batch of training data.

### Training Process

The script seems to include steps for training a simple classifier, but the training loop is not explicitly defined in the provided code.

## 4. Autoencoder Training

### Defining Autoencoder Components

```python
def Encoder(x, w):
    return x @ w[0]

def Decoder(x, w):
    return x @ (w[0].T)

def Autoencoder(x, w):
    return Decoder(Encoder(x, w), w)
```

- Functions for the encoder, decoder, and the complete autoencoder are defined.

### Training the Autoencoder

```python
for step in range(steps):
    x, y = get_batch('train')
    x2 = Autoencoder(x, w)
    loss = MSE(x2, x)
    ...
```

- Implements a training loop for the autoencoder using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function.
- The weights are updated using an optimizer.

## Conclusion

This script showcases a variety of techniques in machine learning and image processing. It covers data loading, preprocessing, visualization, and training of simple linear classifiers and autoencoders. The use of PyTorch for deep learning tasks and visualization techniques for understanding the data are key highlights of this script.
