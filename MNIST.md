# Detailed Code Breakdown: Image Classification and Visualization

The following sections provide an in-depth analysis of a Python script focusing on image classification and visualization, primarily utilizing PyTorch and Matplotlib libraries.

## 1. Data Preparation and Visualization

### Setup and Data Loading

The script initializes by importing necessary libraries (`numpy`, `matplotlib`, `torch`, `torchvision`, `wandb`, `skimage`) and setting up functions for handling GPU computations and plotting.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import torch
from torchvision import datasets
from skimage.util import montage
!pip install wandb
import wandb as wb
from skimage.io import imread
```

Key functions defined include:
- `GPU(data)`: Transfers data to GPU for computation.
- `GPU_data(data)`: Similar to `GPU(data)` but sets `requires_grad` to False.
- `plot(x)`: Utility for plotting images.
- `montage_plot(x)`: Creates a montage from a set of images.

### Data Acquisition

The script then loads one of the following datasets: MNIST, KMNIST, or Fashion MNIST. These datasets consist of images (handwritten digits, Kuzushiji characters, or fashion items, respectively) and their corresponding labels.

```python
train_set = datasets.MNIST('./data', train=True, download=True)
test_set = datasets.MNIST('./data', train=False, download=True)
```

### Data Processing and Visualization

Images and labels are extracted from the datasets, normalized, and reshaped. The script visualizes individual images and a montage of multiple images using `plot` and `montage_plot` functions.

```python
X = train_set.data.numpy()
Y = train_set.targets.numpy()
X = X[:, None, :, :] / 255
x = X[3, 0, :, :]
plot(x)
montage_plot(X[125:150, 0, :, :])
```

## 2. Random Matrix Multiplication and Performance Evaluation

### Creating Random Matrices and Batches

The script generates random matrices and performs matrix multiplication with a batch of images. The purpose is to simulate a simplistic linear classification model.

```python
M = GPU(np.random.rand(10, 784))
x = X[:, 0:64]
y = M @ x
```

### Classification and Accuracy Computation

It then converts these matrix multiplication results into class predictions and computes the accuracy against true labels.

```python
y = torch.argmax(y, 0)
accuracy = torch.sum((y == Y[0:64])) / 64
```

## 3. Histograms and Heatmaps

### Visualization of Data Distributions

The script includes code to visualize data distributions using histograms and heatmaps, showcasing different numpy functions to generate and reshape random data.

```python
z = np.random.rand(10, 784)
plt.hist(z.flatten(), 1000)
```

## 4. Optimization with Random Search

### Random Walk for Optimal Matrix

The script performs a simple random search to find an optimal matrix (`M`) that maximizes the classification accuracy. This is a brute-force approach to optimization.

```python
M_Best = 0
Score_Best = 0
for i in range(100000):
    M_new = GPU(np.random.rand(10, 784))
    ...
    if Score > Score_Best:
        Score_Best = Score
        M_Best = M_new
```

## 5. Classification and Visualization of Test Data

### Final Model Testing and Visualization

Finally, the script applies the best-found matrix to classify test data and visualizes these test images along with their predicted and actual labels.

```python
for i in range(10):
    guess = y_test[0, i].item()
    answer = int(Y_test[i])
    plot(X_test[:, i].reshape(28, 28), f"Guess: {guess}   ---   Actual: {answer}")
```

## Conclusion

This Python script demonstrates a blend of data visualization, basic image classification using random matrices, and performance evaluation. It provides insights into data handling, matrix operations, and visualization techniques in Python, particularly using libraries like PyTorch and Matplotlib.
